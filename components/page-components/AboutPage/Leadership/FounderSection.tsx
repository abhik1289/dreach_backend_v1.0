She endured high costs and exhaustion from constant travel and stays in different locations to receive the care she needed. Seeing her struggle, I felt driven to create a solution that would break down these barriers to quality healthcare. Dr. Reach was born out of a desire to ensure accessibility to comprehensive medical assistance and optimal treatment options without undue hardship, so that others like my mother wouldn't have to face similar obstacles.`,
